## 🚨 Common Signs You Might Be Struggling

- You attribute success to luck or timing—not skill.
- You fear others will “find out you’re not good enough.”
- You hesitate to apply for jobs or speak in meetings.
- You over-prepare or avoid showing your work entirely.
- You brush off compliments with “It was nothing.”

Sound familiar? You’re far from alone.

## 🛠️ How to Cope with Impostor Syndrome

### 1. **Normalize It**
- Understand that 70–80% of professionals experience it at some point.
- Even Nobel Prize winners have talked about it.

### 2. **Document Your Wins**
- Keep a “brag file” or achievement journal.
- Save compliments, solved bugs, and shipped features.

### 3. **Talk About It**
- Share your feelings with trusted peers or mentors.
- Chances are, they’ve felt the same way.

### 4. **Focus on Learning, Not Knowing**
- In tech, **curiosity beats certainty**.
- Reframe “I don’t know this” into “I’m about to learn this.”

### 5. **Teach Others**
- Explaining concepts (even the basics) reinforces your own knowledge.
- It also shows how much you actually know.

### 6. **Detach Identity from Work**
- Your self-worth is not tied to how much code you ship.
- Value process, not just output.

## 💬 Final Words

Impostor Syndrome doesn’t mean you’re broken.  
It means you care.  
It means you’re growing.

The truth? No one knows everything. Not the senior dev. Not the speaker at the last conference. Not even the guy who wrote the library you’re using.

> _You belong. You’re enough. And you’re doing better than you think._
