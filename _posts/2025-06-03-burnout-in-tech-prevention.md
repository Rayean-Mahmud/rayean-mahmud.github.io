Tech is fast-paced, exciting, and innovative — but it’s also a **breeding ground for burnout**. With endless deadlines, always-on culture, and high expectations, even the most passionate developers can hit a wall.

Burnout isn’t just being tired — it’s chronic physical and emotional exhaustion, often coupled with cynicism and decreased performance.

Let’s break it down — how to spot it, what causes it, and how to prevent it.

## 🔚 Final Thoughts

Burnout doesn’t mean you’re weak — it means your **system is overloaded**.

In tech, where output is often prized over well-being, it’s crucial to make space for rest and reflection. Long-term success isn’t about how much you hustle — it’s about how well you **sustain** your energy and passion.
